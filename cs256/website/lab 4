keep track of how many times you have evaluated the rules

look at each rule one at a time

evaluate the predicate list 
evaluate each predicate as if it was a query

first make sure the relations are joinable
iterate through set of tuples
pass in two interators

joinable is a member function that 

joinable takes in two iterators
look at each tuple individually

joinable(iterator for set of tuples, iterator, schema)



What does the join function look like?


Use the project function that you already wrote

join ()
make the scheme - make sure you don't add duplicates
build from ground up instead of deleting
